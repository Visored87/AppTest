Scholarships

What is a scholarship?

- A scholarship is a financial award given to a student on the basis of academic achievement and promise. However, some also take into account financial need. 

- Scholarships do not have to be repaid. There are 3 types of scholarships you can apply for: 

	- university scholarships

	- department-sponsored scholarships

	- external (non-UNT) scholarships.

- UNT offers several scholarships for international students. See a list of scholarships available to international students.

- Some academic departments provide funding to international students in the form of fellowships, scholarships and assistantships. 

	** Please contact individual academic departments for more information.

- If you are transferring to UNT from another college or university, you may be eligible for the UNT Transfer Scholarship.

- If you will be a graduate student, please refer to the International Students information on the Toulouse Graduate School's Funding Your Graduate Education page.

** Note for IELI students: You will be eligible to apply for scholarships at UNT when you graduate from IELI.



How to apply for scholarships

1. The first step in the scholarship process is to apply for admission to UNT.

	- Scholarship dollars are limited and are awarded on merit and on a first-come, first-served basis. 

	- If you complete your admission application early, you can be considered for admission early, 
	and place yourself in the best position to be considered for available funds.

2. The next step in the scholarship process is to create a profile in the Eagle Scholarship Portal by March 1.

	- You should submit this application annually to be considered for any scholarship opportunities available during the upcoming academic year. 

	- You do not have to already be accepted to UNT to create a profile in the Eagle Scholarship Portal. 
	All you need is an active EUID, which you will receive instructions for how to activate once you have applied for admission to UNT. 
	
	** However, in order to be selected for any UNT scholarship award, you must be admitted to a UNT degree seeking program and meet 
	the minimum eligibility requirements of the scholarship by the scholarship deadline.

3. Apply to any department-sponsored scholarships.

	- Each department has their own application process, which will detail the criteria for scholarship consideration. 

	- Typically, departmental scholarship awards are made to students with specific program involvement with the department. 

		** Students should contact departments from their major or minor area of study to find out what scholarships are offered and about 
		the scholarship application process.



When will you know if I receive a scholarship award?

UNT Scholarships:

	- Students selected for a scholarship based on their profile in the Eagle Scholarship Portal are notified through EagleConnect, UNT's official email service. 

	- Monitor EagleConnect and my.unt.edu for award information. Most awards will be announced by late June for the Fall semester.

Departmental Scholarships

	- Each department on campus makes departmental scholarship award decisions. 

	- Award information is coordinated with FAS to post the awards to the student's account.

How do you accept a scholarship award?

	- Once you have received a scholarship, you must accept it to get the money. 

	- Scholarship funds will not disburse to your student account until your awards have been accepted online or your external scholarship funds 
	have been received by UNT.



Other Financial Assistance:

- Most international students are not eligible to apply for federal financial aid, but are encouraged to be sure by visiting the Department of Education's Student Aid website to 
learn about status as an eligible non-citizen. Other types of aid may be available however, such as grants and alternative loans. 

- International students can qualify for in-state, resident tuition in many ways through International Admissions. Learn more about resident tuition rates for international students.

- EducationUSA Advising Centers has compiled a list of funding opportunities including scholarships and grants.

- UNT offers approximately 3,500 student jobs on campus through the UNT Career Center. 

	** Eligible international students can work for a maximum of 20 hours a week during the semesters and 40 hours a week during the summer 
	and winter holidays if they are not enrolled. 

	** To find out if you are eligible for on-campus employment, please contact UNT International Student and Scholar Services.



How to check if all of your scholarships and financial aid awards have disbursed:

- The Financial Aid and Scholarships office processes all financial aid, loans, grants and scholarships.

	**Financial aid funds will not disburse to your student account until your financial aid awards have been accepted online.

- Once the awards are approved and funded (eg: student loans are received from the bank/lender), any anticipated aid is removed from your account and 
the Student Accounting department posts the amounts to your student account.

- View your account summary at my.unt.edu to determine if any award has been posted to your account.
